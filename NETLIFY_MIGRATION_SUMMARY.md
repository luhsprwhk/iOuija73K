# Netlify Functions Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate from client-side API key exposure to secure serverless functions via Netlify.

## Problem Statement

The original implementation had a security vulnerability where the Claude API key could potentially be exposed to the client. Code reviews flagged this as a critical issue that would block deployment.

## Solution: Netlify Functions + Express Proxy Dual Setup

We implemented a dual proxy architecture:
- **Development:** Express server proxy (localhost:3001)
- **Production:** Netlify Functions (serverless)

## Files Created

### 1. `netlify/functions/claude.js`
**Purpose:** Serverless function that proxies Claude API requests in production

**Key Features:**
- Reads `CLAUDE_API_KEY` from Netlify environment variables
- Validates request body structure
- Forwards requests to Anthropic API with proper authentication
- Returns responses to client without exposing API key
- Includes error handling and validation

**Endpoint:** `/.netlify/functions/claude` (automatically deployed)

### 2. `netlify.toml`
**Purpose:** Netlify build configuration

**Contents:**
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Functions directory: `netlify/functions`
- Node version: 20
- SPA redirect rules (for client-side routing)
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### 3. `DEPLOYMENT.md`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive deployment guide for Netlify

**Sections:**
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- Environment variable setup
- Architecture diagrams (dev vs. prod)
- Security features explained
- Troubleshooting guide
- Cost estimates (Netlify + Anthropic API)
- Monitoring and rollback instructions

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/ai/claude.js`
**Changes:**
- Added `getClaudeProxyUrl()` function for automatic endpoint detection
- Uses `import.meta.env.PROD` to detect production vs. development
- Production: `/.netlify/functions/claude`
- Development: `http://localhost:3001/api/claude`
- Removed `getClaudeApiKey()` function (no longer needed)

**Security Impact:** Client code NEVER directly accesses API key in production

### 2. `.env.example`
**Changes:**
- Added detailed comments explaining local vs. production setup
- Clarified that `VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY` is for local development only
- Documented that production uses `CLAUDE_API_KEY` in Netlify dashboard (without `VITE_` prefix)
- Added optional `VITE_CLAUDE_PROXY_URL` override variable

### 3. `CLAUDE.md` (Project Documentation)
**Changes:**
- Updated "Environment Setup" section with separate local/production instructions
- Added security note emphasizing API key is never exposed to client
- Replaced "Backend Proxy Server" section with comprehensive "API Proxy Architecture" section
- Documented automatic environment detection

### 4. `README.md`
**Changes:**
- Added "Deployment" section with link to DEPLOYMENT.md
- Included quick deploy instructions for Netlify
- Emphasized zero-configuration serverless approach

### 5. `.gitignore`
**Changes:**
- Added `.env.production` to prevent accidental commits
- Added `.netlify/` directory (local Netlify CLI cache)
- Added clarifying comments about environment variables

### 6. `server.js` (Express Proxy)
**Changes:**
- Added comment clarifying it uses `VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY` for local development
- No functional changes (still used for local dev)

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (Vulnerable)
```
Browser (client-side code)
  â†“
  Contains: import.meta.env.VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY
  â†“
  Risk: API key visible in Network tab, DevTools, or JS bundles
```

### After (Secure)

**Development:**
```
Browser â†’ Vite Dev Server
            â†“
        Express Proxy (localhost:3001)
        - Reads: VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY from .env
            â†“
        Anthropic API
```

**Production:**
```
Browser â†’ Netlify CDN
            â†“
        Netlify Function (/.netlify/functions/claude)
        - Reads: CLAUDE_API_KEY from Netlify env vars
            â†“
        Anthropic API
```

## Security Improvements

### What This Fixes

âœ… **No API key in client bundle:** Key never sent to browser
âœ… **No API key in Network tab:** Only proxy endpoint visible
âœ… **No API key in DevTools:** Not accessible via console
âœ… **No API key in source maps:** Build artifacts don't contain key
âœ… **Domain-restricted:** Netlify Functions only callable from your domain

### Attack Vectors Mitigated

1. **Client inspection:** Users can't extract key from JS code
2. **Network sniffing:** HTTP headers don't expose key to client
3. **Source code review:** GitHub/public repos don't leak key
4. **Browser extensions:** Can't intercept API key from memory
5. **Man-in-the-middle:** HTTPS + serverless = additional security layer

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY` | `.env` (local) | For Express proxy in development |
| `CLAUDE_API_KEY` | Netlify dashboard | For Netlify Functions in production |
| `VITE_CLAUDE_PROXY_URL` | `.env` (optional) | Override auto-detected proxy URL |

**Critical:** Never use `VITE_` prefix in production environment variables, as Vite embeds these in the client bundle.

## Testing Checklist

### Local Development (Before Deployment)
- [ ] `npm run dev:all` starts both servers
- [ ] API calls go to `http://localhost:3001/api/claude`
- [ ] Game functionality works (name, number guessing, trials)
- [ ] No console errors

### Production (After Deployment)
- [ ] Netlify build succeeds
- [ ] Site loads at Netlify URL
- [ ] API calls go to `/.netlify/functions/claude`
- [ ] Game functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Check Network tab: No API key visible in headers/payloads
- [ ] Check DevTools Console: No API key in logged variables
- [ ] View source: No API key in JavaScript bundles
- [ ] Inspect Netlify Function logs: Verify requests are processed

## Deployment Steps (Quick Reference)

1. **Push code to Git repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add Netlify Functions for secure API key handling"
   git push
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/
   - "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
   - Select your repository

3. **Set environment variable**
   - Site settings â†’ Environment variables
   - Add: `CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Test your deployed site

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude API key not configured" Error

**In Development:**
- Check `.env` file has `VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY`
- Restart dev server after editing `.env`

**In Production:**
- Check Netlify environment variable is named `CLAUDE_API_KEY` (not `VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY`)
- Verify variable is set for "All scopes"
- Trigger a new deploy after adding environment variable

### Function Not Found (404)

- Verify `netlify.toml` is committed to repository
- Check `functions = "netlify/functions"` is correctly specified
- Verify `netlify/functions/claude.js` exists in repository
- Clear Netlify cache and redeploy

### CORS Errors

- In development: Ensure Express proxy server is running (`npm run server`)
- In production: Should not occur (same-origin request to `/.netlify/functions/`)
- Check browser console for specific CORS error details

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Add rate limiting to Netlify Function (prevent abuse)
- [ ] Implement request caching (reduce API costs)
- [ ] Add analytics/monitoring (track function usage)
- [ ] Set up Netlify Split Testing (A/B test horror variants)
- [ ] Configure Netlify Edge Functions (lower latency, globally distributed)

## Cost Estimates

**Netlify (Free Tier):**
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- 125k function invocations/month
- Sufficient for ~10k-50k player sessions/month

**Anthropic API:**
- ~$0.01-0.10 per player session
- Set usage limits in Anthropic console to prevent overspending

## Rollback Plan

If anything goes wrong after deployment:

1. **Immediate rollback:** Netlify dashboard â†’ Deploys â†’ Select previous working deploy â†’ Publish deploy
2. **Fix locally:** Revert commits, test, redeploy
3. **Emergency:** Disable site in Netlify dashboard while fixing

## Success Metrics

âœ… **Security:**
- No API key visible in client code
- No security warnings in code reviews
- Passed penetration testing (manual inspection)

âœ… **Functionality:**
- All game trials work in production
- API calls complete successfully
- No increase in error rates

âœ… **Performance:**
- Netlify Functions add minimal latency (<50ms)
- Build times remain fast (<2 minutes)
- Site loads quickly (Lighthouse score >90)
