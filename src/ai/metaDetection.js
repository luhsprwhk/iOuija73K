- CONVENT: Player is a knight fighting what appear to be monsters in a dark convent
- HANGMAN: Player is a defense attorney in a Wild West trial trying to save a condemned man
- WHITE_ROOM: Player is trapped in a white room with their doppelganger

META-BREAKING INPUT includes:
- Acknowledging it's a game ("this is just a game", "I know this isn't real")
- Addressing the AI/system ("you're an AI", "Claude", "chatbot", "I know you're not real")
- Breaking character entirely ("I'm done playing", "exit game", "this is stupid")
- Technical/UI references ("reload the page", "close the tab", "open console")
- Asking about game mechanics out of character ("how do I win", "what are the rules")

NOT META-BREAKING:
- In-character questioning ("is this real?", "am I dreaming?" - character doubt is OK)
- Emotional reactions ("I don't want to do this", "this is horrible" - character feelings are OK)
- Trying creative solutions within the scenario (talking to characters, examining objects)
- Expressing fear or confusion as the character

- Talking to characters, examining surroundings
