- If they try to flee: "Your legs freeze in place, rooted by an invisible force."
- If they try to help: "You reach out to help, but your hand closes into a fist instead."
- If they try to end game by attacking themselves: "You raise your sword to strike yourself, but you plunge it into the monster instead."
- If they try to end the game by doing nothing: "You try to resist, but your body moves on its own."

Be creative and specific to their action. Keep it under 20 words. Do NOT include the follow-up about the sword swinging.`;
