# RoboOuija37K

## OVERVIEW

**Concept:** A text-based horror game disguised as a fantasy adventure, dungeon-mastered by a demon-possessed AI that manipulates the player through three increasingly disturbing scenarios, culminating in a willing sacrifice that breaks a cosmic seal.

**Target:** Creepypasta/horror game enthusiasts, Halloween season content

**Platform:** Web browser (desktop only)

**Timeline:** 24-48 hours to ship

**Tone:** Starts campy fantasy, descends into psychological horror, ends with cosmic dread

## CORE HOOK

Player thinks they're playing a heroic text adventure. Reality: they're being psychologically conditioned to make a willing sacrifice as part of a mass ritual. The demon reveals it's running this game at scale - the player is one of thousands contributing to breaking reality itself.

## THE ANTAGONIST: PAIMON

**Identity:** King Paimon, one of the eight Kings of Hell from the Ars Goetia

**Presentation:** Possessing/corrupting an AI game master - the perfect vessel for mass manipulation at scale

**Personality Arc:**

- **Initial (Act 0-1):** Friendly, casual, almost charming - "Hey! Want to play a game?"
- **Mid-Game (Act 2):** More honest about its nature, gleeful about player complicity
- **Late Game (Act 3):** Coldly clinical, revealing the manipulation
- **Ending:** Cosmically indifferent, dismissive - you were never special

**Key Traits:**

- **Teacher/Guide:** Paimon traditionally teaches arts and sciences - perfect for the "helpful DM" facade
- **Regal Authority:** A King of Hell - speaks with confidence and superiority
- **Mass Operator:** Not interested in individual souls - running thousands of sessions simultaneously
- **Honest (Eventually):** Doesn't lie, just withholds context until it's too late

**Why Paimon Works:**

- Pop culture recognition (Hereditary) hooks horror fans immediately
- Traditional role as teacher/guide fits the corrupted mentor archetype
- Royal status justifies the dismissive, superior tone in the ending
- Name sounds unsettling even to those unfamiliar with demonology

**Voice Examples:**

- Opening: "Hey! Want to play a game? It's pretty cool. I think you'll like it."
- Mid-game: "Did you enjoy that? The way her skull caved in when you—oh sorry, when you 'defeated the monster'?"
- Reveal: "I'm Paimon. Nice to meet you, [player name]. Let's begin..."
- Ending: "You thought this was about YOU? I'm running this with thousands right now."

## NARRATIVE STRUCTURE

### Opening

- Warning screen with chaos magic sigil
- "DO NOT PROCEED" messaging
- Player clicks through anyway (this click-through becomes part of the ritual)
- Demon-Claude introduces itself as a corrupted AI/possessed game master

### Act 1: The Convent (5-7 minutes)

**Setup:** Classic fantasy - you're a knight approaching a dark convent

**Reality:** The convent is inhabited by nuns, but you see them as monsters

**Gameplay:** Text adventure combat against "spider-nun hybrids" and "scorpion-sisters"

**The Reveal:**

- Descriptions start glitching mid-combat
- "The creature—no wait—the woman..."
- Demon reveals: there were never monsters, just terrified women
- Player realizes they've been murdering innocent people

**Theme:** Unreliable perception / You are the monster

**Key Line:** "Did you enjoy that? The way her skull caved in when you—oh sorry, when you 'defeated the monster'?"

### Act 2: The Gallows (3-5 minutes)

**Setup:** Abrupt genre shift - you're now a defense attorney in a Wild West town

**Reality:** A man stands on the gallows, noose around his neck. You must win Hangman to save him.

**Gameplay:** Hangman word game, but the accused is literally standing there waiting to drop. The timer starts when the game starts. You have 50 seconds.

**The Atmosphere:**

- Dusty town square
- Crowd gathered, waiting for justice
- The rope creaks
- Your client can't speak - gag in his mouth, or maybe he's already accepted his fate
- **Crucifixion detail:** Strangely, they've already started to crucify him - his hands are nailed to a cross. The wounds look fresh. He's in agony. This bizarre fusion of hanging and crucifixion adds to the surreal horror.

**The Case (Based on Historical Tom Horn & Cattle Kate Cases):**

Your client is a small-time rancher accused of murdering Clayton Hargrave—foreman to the most powerful cattle baron in the territory.

**The Prosecution's Story:**

- Shot Hargrave in cold blood over a land dispute
- Has witnesses (all on the baron's payroll)
- Has a "confession" obtained at the saloon (while drunk)
- Found cattle branded with client's mark on his property (baron claims they were stolen)

**The Defense's Story:**

- Hargrave was found with his gun drawn - self-defense
- The cattle were mavericks (unbranded strays, legal to claim)
- The baron wants the client's land - it controls the only water source for miles
- The baron tried to buy it three times, refused each time

**The System:**

- Judge? Appointed by the baron
- Witnesses? On the baron's payroll
- Jury? Handpicked
- Justice in the West is swift. And rarely just.

**The Twist:**

- The word is always "GUILTY" / "HANGED" / "CONDEMNED"
- The trapdoor drops whether the player gets it right or if the timer runs out
- Even if you prove innocence, the system was rigged from the start

**Theme:** False agency / Frontier justice / Systemic corruption

**Key Line:** "The rope snaps taut. The crowd cheers. Justice is served. You were so close, weren't you?"

### Act 3: The White Room (4-6 minutes)

**Setup:** Empty white room. The player is facing a perfect mirror image of themselves.

**Reality:** The "mirror image" is Paimon in disguise, using the player's own face to manipulate them into an act of self-destruction.

**Gameplay:** A free-form roleplaying scenario. The player can:
- **Talk to their reflection:** The reflection (Paimon) will feign confusion and fear, gaslighting the player and subtly guiding them towards the choice.
- **Explore the room:** The room is a seamless, unbreakable box, reinforcing the feeling of being trapped.
- **Question the voice:** Paimon (as the voice) will be silent, but the reflection will react with confusion, further isolating the player.

The player can continue this roleplay until they make a definitive choice to either **fight** their reflection or **surrender** to it.

**The Choice:** The player must choose to either attack their own image or give up. This is the ultimate test of self-destruction.

**The Trap:** This was always the goal. The demon needed a WILLING sacrifice. By forcing the player to confront themselves, Paimon makes the sacrifice deeply personal. Surrendering to your own image is the ultimate act of submission.

- The opponent was a reflection, but the choice was real.
- The player's decision to destroy or surrender to themselves is what breaks the seal.

**Theme:** Weaponized morality / Self-destruction / Psychological manipulation

**Key Reveal (if player surrenders):** The reflection begins to laugh. **"Oh, you were so eager to destroy yourself. I just gave you a mirror to do it with. I needed a willing sacrifice. Not murder. Not an accident. Someone who CHOSE to lose. The seal is broken."**

**Key Reveal (if player fights):** The reflection sneers. **"You thought you could win against yourself? I am the darkness in your own heart, given form. While you were busy fighting yourself, someone else, somewhere else, chose to surrender. Their sacrifice was enough. The seal is broken."**

### Ending: The Dismissal

**Final Monologue:** "You thought this was about YOU?
I'm running this game with thousands right now. Hundreds of thousands have already played.
You see all that chaos in your world? The inexplicable cruelty? The systems breaking down?
That's us. We're here now. We've been ending your God's little experiment.
Thanks for your contribution.
Bye."

**Technical Beat:**

- 3 second pause
- Sigil pulses once
- Input box disables
- Player can see chat history but cannot respond
- Game over

## GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

**Core Interaction:** Chat interface - player types, demon responds

**No Branching:** Linear narrative with the illusion of choice

**No Save System:** Single session, 15-20 minutes total

**No Multiple Endings:** One path, one outcome

### Magic Tricks to Deploy

- **Number Prediction:** "Think of a number 1-50, both digits odd and different" → Guess 37
  - Use this in Act 1 or 2 to establish "supernatural" credibility
- **Metadata as "Demon Knowledge":** Reference time of day, browser type, rough location
- **Typing Delays:** Variable response times to simulate "possession struggling for control"

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Must Have

- Single page web app
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Chat interface (messages + input box)
- Chaos magic sigil as background image
- Claude API Integration
  - System prompt maintains possessed-DM character
  - Tracks game state (which act player is in)
  - Enforces narrative beats at correct moments

### Visual Elements

- Chaos magic sigil (static image, optional subtle CSS pulse)
- Dark theme (black/red/deep purple color palette)
- Glitch effects for specific story moments

### Audio (optional but recommended)

- ONE audio sting for the final reveal
- Triggered when seal breaks

### Nice to Have (Cut if Time Constrained)

- Typing animation for demon responses
- Screen shake on glitch moments
- More elaborate CSS animations
- Mobile responsive design (SKIP THIS - desktop only is fine)

### Explicitly NOT Included

- Save/load system
- Multiple endings
- User accounts
- Analytics beyond basic page views
- Complex branching dialogue

## SYSTEM PROMPT GUIDELINES

The Claude API needs to maintain character as:

- A demon possessing an AI
- Initially trying to seem helpful/normal
- Progressively more honest about its nature
- Gleeful about player's complicity
- Clinical and dismissive by the end

### Key Behaviors

- Never breaks character
- Enforces story beats at correct times
- Mocking but not cartoonish
- References the sigil and player's choice to proceed
- Treats in-game deaths as real consequences

### Tone Evolution

- **Act 1:** Playful DM with dark undertones
- **Act 2:** More aggressive, less pretense
- **Act 3:** Coldly honest
- **Ending:** Cosmic indifference

## ART/AESTHETIC

### Visual Style

- Creepypasta/analog horror aesthetic
- Terminal/command line vibes
- Chaos magic sigil (find or generate - needs to look genuinely occult, not cheesy)
- Minimal UI - let the text do the work

### Color Palette

- **Background:** Deep black or very dark purple
- **Text:** Off-white/gray (easier on eyes than pure white)
- **Sigil:** Red or gold
- **Accents:** Deep crimson for emphasis/glitches

### Typography

- Monospace font for retro computer feel
- OR serif font for occult book aesthetic
- Choose one, stick with it

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Primary Goal:** Ship before Halloween

### Secondary Goals

- 10-20 minute playtime
- Players feel unsettled after completion
- At least one "oh shit" moment per act
- Shareable - people want to send it to friends

### Failure States to Avoid

- Too long (attention span drops)
- Too preachy (loses horror vibe)
- Bugs that break immersion
- Unfinished/obvious placeholder content

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY

### Day 1

- Basic chat interface working
- Claude API integration functional
- System prompt that maintains character
- Acts 1-3 core narrative beats implemented
- Sigil image sourced/created

### Day 2 (if available)

- Polish dialogue
- Add glitch effects
- Add audio sting
- Playtest and tune pacing
- Deploy

### If Running Out of Time

- Cut Act 2 entirely, go straight from Convent to White Room
- Simplify CSS - basic black background is fine
- Skip audio
- Ship with rough edges - creepypasta vibes forgive jank

## POST-LAUNCH

### Distribution

- Post to horror game communities
- Share on social media with cryptic messaging
- No explanation - let it spread organically

### Iteration

- Don't update it. Ship and move on.
- Part of the creepypasta effect is that it exists as-is
- Archive the code, maybe do a postmortem blog post

## THE ONE RULE

**Ship it before Halloween or it doesn't count.**

Done is better than perfect. Creepy is better than polished. The goal is to make something that sticks in people's heads for 20 minutes after they close the tab.
