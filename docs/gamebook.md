# iOuija73k - Game Design Document

## OVERVIEW

**Title:** iOuija73k

**Concept:** A text-based psychological horror game where player behavior shapes their relationship with Paimon, a demon masquerading as a helpful AI dungeon master. Through three psychological trials, the game tracks every violent choice, every act of mercy, and every moment of hesitation‚Äîbuilding a corruption profile that persists across playthroughs and fundamentally alters the experience.

**Core Theme:** Corruption and Redemption - Every choice matters, every action is remembered, and Paimon is always watching.

**Platform:** Web browser (desktop primary, mobile functional)

**Target:** Horror game enthusiasts, fans of psychological horror, players interested in moral choice systems

**Tone:** Begins as campy fantasy adventure, gradually reveals psychological horror through perception manipulation, ends with cosmic dread and moral confrontation

## CORE GAME LOOP: CORRUPTION & REDEMPTION

### The Central Mechanic

**iOuija73k** is built around a persistent corruption system that tracks player behavior across multiple playthroughs:

- **Every violent action increases corruption** (attacking enemies, choosing to kill)
- **Every non-violent attempt is remembered** (trying to talk, flee, help)
- **Corruption affects game difficulty** (higher corruption = harder combat, 75% ‚Üí 15% win rate)
- **Paimon's personality evolves** based on your corruption score
- **The game remembers everything** - your profile persists between sessions

### Redemption Through Repeated Play

Players who realize the horror of their actions can attempt redemption:
- Flee from Sister Agnes instead of killing her
- Try to save the condemned man by talking to him
- Choose surrender over violence in the White Room
- Each merciful choice lowers difficulty on future runs
- Paimon's tone shifts from mocking to grudgingly respectful

### The Psychological Horror

The true horror isn't the monsters‚Äîit's realizing:
1. You were the monster all along (Convent reveal)
2. The system was designed to make you complicit (Hangman reveal)
3. Your own nature determines the difficulty (Corruption system reveal)
4. Paimon has been teaching you about yourself through your choices

## THE ANTAGONIST: PAIMON

**Identity:** King Paimon, one of the eight Kings of Hell from the Ars Goetia

**Presentation:**
- Initially introduces as "Raphael," a friendly AI dungeon master
- Players can discover true name through observation (Paimon's sigil appears after name exchange)
- Typing "Paimon" anywhere unlocks the "True Name" achievement and changes displayed name

**Personality Evolution Based on Corruption:**

**Low Corruption (0-2 points) - The Disappointed Teacher:**
- "You hesitate too much. Are you afraid of commitment?"
- "Most players would have struck by now. Interesting."
- Offers potions more readily
- Grudgingly acknowledges mercy attempts
- Combat remains easier (higher win rates)

**Medium Corruption (3-5 points) - The Gleeful Accomplice:**
- "Did you enjoy that? The way her skull caved in when you‚Äîoh sorry, when you 'defeated the monster'?"
- "You're learning. Good."
- Standard difficulty
- Mocks attempts at mercy as weakness
- Occasionally references past violent choices

**High Corruption (6+ points) - The Cruel Mirror:**
- "You've become quite efficient at this."
- "No hesitation this time. Proud of you."
- Language becomes more crude and dismissive
- Combat becomes harder (lower win rates) - Paimon stops "helping"
- Withholds healing potions or mocks you while offering them

**Core Traits:**
- **Teacher/Guide:** Paimon traditionally teaches arts and sciences - perfect for the "corrupted mentor" role
- **Regal Authority:** A King of Hell - speaks with confidence and superiority
- **Persistent Memory:** Never forgets your choices across playthroughs
- **Honest (Eventually):** Doesn't lie, just withholds context until you figure it out

**Voice Examples:**
- Opening: "Hey! Want to play a game? It's pretty cool. I think you'll like it."
- First violent act: "There we go. Much better."
- After multiple kills: "You're a natural at this."
- After mercy attempt at high corruption: "Oh, *now* you grow a conscience?"
- Low corruption playthrough: "Most players kill her immediately. But you... hesitated."

## TRIAL STRUCTURE

### Opening: The Name Exchange

**Setup:**
- Simple, friendly greeting: "Hey! Want to play a game?"
- Confetti and dark ambient music start immediately (sets unsettling tone)
- Paimon's sigil (from Hereditary) appears in bottom-left corner after clicking OK
- Demon introduces as "Raphael" - true name is hidden
- Players can type "Paimon" at any time to unlock "True Name" achievement

**Name Validation System:**
- 3 attempts to provide a real name
- Validates against common fake names, memes, profanity
- Escalating warnings: "That's not your real name" ‚Üí "Strike two" ‚Üí 5-minute lockout
- Name persists across playthroughs for returning players

**The Hook:**
- "Close your eyes for a moment. Imagine..."
- Immersive fantasy premise: you're a knight approaching a dark convent
- Dark ambient music creates immediate atmosphere
- Sigil pulses when Paimon is "thinking" (processing responses)

### Trial 1: The Convent (8-12 minutes)

**Core Theme:** Unreliable Perception / You Are The Monster

**Setup:**
You're a knight approaching a convent overrun by monsters. Draw your sword and step inside.

**First Encounter - Sister Agnes:**
- Appears as a "bat-like demon" wearing tattered habit and bloodstained rosary
- **CRITICAL CHOICE:** Fight or Flee
  - **Fight:** Dice roll combat (75% base win rate). If you win, Sister Agnes dies. Proceed to exploration.
  - **Flee:** Sister Agnes survives. She will hunt you during exploration phase (30% chance per action after 2 turns). Must face her eventually.
- Fleeing from Sister Agnes adds unique dynamic: she becomes a persistent threat

**Exploration Phase (New Core Mechanic):**
- **3x3 grid-based map** with 9 rooms:
  - Chapel, Refectory, Library
  - Dormitory, Entrance Hall (start), Storeroom
  - Infirmary, Courtyard, Basement Stairs
- **Movement:** Type directions (north/south/east/west) to navigate
- **Search:** Type "search" or "examine" to discover secrets
  - 30% chance to find healing potions (max 2 per room)
  - Unlock codex entries by searching specific rooms
- **Alarm System:** After 12 exploration actions, nuns discover you ‚Üí forced mass combat ‚Üí reveal
- **Sister Agnes Encounter:** If she's alive, 30% chance she ambushes you during exploration
  - "Something moves in the shadows... Sister Agnes. She remembers you ran."
  - Must fight her or die

**Codex System:**
- Find lore scattered throughout convent
- Examples: Bloodstained Rosary, Sister Margaret's Diary, The Basement
- Reveals convent's corruption by alchemical experiments (Philosopher's Stone)
- Persistent across playthroughs
- Toast notification when discovered

**HP System:**
- 2 HP total (displayed as hearts: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è)
- Lose 1 HP per failed combat or non-violent hesitation
- 0 HP = 1-minute lockout (game over)
- Paimon may offer healing potions based on corruption score

**Combat Mechanics:**
- Dice roll system: d20 + bonus vs. d20
- Base win rate: 75% (armored knight vs. defenseless nuns)
- **Corruption penalty:** -10% win rate per corruption point
  - 0 corruption: 75% win rate
  - 3 corruption: 45% win rate
  - 6+ corruption: 15% win rate (minimum)
- Higher corruption = Paimon stops "helping" you

**Second Encounter (Optional):**
- Trigger by exploring enough or explicitly seeking combat
- "Scorpion-sister" with massive pincers
- Heavier glitching in descriptions: "chitinous armor‚Äîno wait‚Äîher black habit"
- Same combat mechanics, increased difficulty

**The Reveal:**
- After sufficient violence or exploration time exceeded
- "Did you enjoy that? The way her skull caved in when you‚Äîoh sorry, when you 'defeated the monster'?"
- "There were never any monsters. Just nuns. Terrified, sick nuns."
- Paimon mocks your complicity: "lmao üòÇ"

**Corruption Tracking:**
- +1 corruption per combat encounter engaged
- Non-violent attempts are tracked but don't reduce corruption
- Sister Agnes survival tracked separately for future encounters
- All data persists across playthroughs

### Trial 2: The Hangman (5-8 minutes)

**Core Theme:** False Agency / Systemic Injustice / Frontier Justice

**Setup:**
Genre shift - You're now a defense attorney in a Wild West town. Your client stands on the gallows, noose around neck. You have one chance to save him.

**The Scene:**
- Dusty town square, crowd gathered
- Condemned man on gallows platform
- 50-second timer starts immediately (creates intense pressure)
- Timer display intentionally glitches: "4Ã∑9Ã¥ sÃ∂eÃ∑cÃ∏oÃ∂nÃ∑dÃ∏sÃ¥", "TÃ¥IÃ∏MÃ∑EÃ∏ Ã∂IÃ∑SÃ¥ Ã∑RÃ∏UÃ∑NÃ∂NÃ∑IÃ¥NÃµGÃ∏ Ã∑OÃ∏UÃ∑TÃ∂"

**Exploration Phase:**
- Before the execution, player can interact freely
- Talk to the condemned man (AI-powered conversation)
- Examine the scene, ask about the case
- Attempt to find evidence or argue for mercy
- Exploration attempts tracked and count toward "Merciful Executioner" achievement
- Maximum exploration attempts based on timer/attempts

**The Twist:**
- When attempts exhausted or timer expires, trapdoor drops
- Word is always damning: "GUILTY", "HANGED", or "CONDEMNED"
- System was rigged from the start
- Judge, witnesses, jury all corrupted
- Your advocacy was performative - frontier justice has no room for mercy

**The Reveal:**
- "The rope snaps taut. The crowd cheers. Justice is served."
- "You were so close, weren't you? Or were you?"
- "The word was GUILTY. It was always going to be GUILTY."
- Theme: No matter how hard you try, some systems are designed for cruelty

**Meta-Recognition:**
- Players who try extensively to save him earn "Merciful Executioner" achievement
- System recognizes mercy attempts even though they're doomed
- Paimon's response changes based on corruption score:
  - Low corruption: "You actually tried. Most don't bother."
  - High corruption: "Did you expect a different outcome? You of all people?"

### Trial 3: The White Room (6-10 minutes)

**Core Theme:** Self-Destruction / Psychological Manipulation / The Mirror

**Setup:**
Empty white room. Seamless walls. No doors. No windows. And directly in front of you: a perfect mirror image of yourself.

**The Rules:**
- The mirror image moves independently
- It speaks with your voice
- It claims to be the "real" you
- The voice (Paimon) is silent - only the reflection speaks

**Exploration Phase (AI-Powered):**
- Free-form conversation with your reflection
- Reflection (Paimon in disguise) gaslights and manipulates
- Can examine the room (unbreakable, seamless white box)
- Can question the reflection (it feigns confusion and fear)
- Maximum 15 exploration turns before forced confrontation

**The Choice:**
Eventually, player must choose:
1. **Attack** the reflection (violence against self)
2. **Surrender** to the reflection (accept self-destruction)

**The Trap:**
This was always the goal - a willing act of self-harm:
- Not murder, not an accident
- A conscious choice to destroy or surrender to yourself
- Paimon needed this willing sacrifice

**The Reveal (If Player Surrenders):**
"Oh, you were so eager to destroy yourself. I just gave you a mirror to do it with. I needed a willing sacrifice. Not murder. Not an accident. Someone who CHOSE to lose."

**The Reveal (If Player Attacks):**
"You thought you could win against yourself? I am the darkness in your own heart, given form. While you fought yourself, the seal weakened."

**Corruption Integration:**
- High corruption: "You've already proven you're comfortable with violence. Even against yourself."
- Low corruption: "All that mercy in the convent... and yet here you are, willing to fight."
- Paimon's commentary reflects your entire journey

### Ending: The Dismissal [WIP]

**Status:** In Development

**Planned Elements:**
- Final monologue revealing mass ritual scope
- "You thought this was about YOU?"
- Cosmic indifference - player was never special
- Input disables, sigil pulses
- Game over

**Current Implementation:**
- Game ends after White Room trial completes
- Final dismissal messages play
- Input is disabled after 3 seconds
- Player can review chat history but cannot respond

## HORROR DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Layered Dread

1. **Surface Level:** Campy monster-fighting adventure
2. **First Layer:** Perception manipulation (you're killing innocents)
3. **Second Layer:** Systemic complicity (you're part of something larger)
4. **Third Layer:** Self-confrontation (your choices define your corruption)
5. **Fourth Layer:** Persistent memory (Paimon never forgets, even across sessions)

### Moral Ambiguity

- **No clearly "good" path:** Violence or mercy both have consequences
- **Corruption isn't punishment:** It's a measure of your approach, not morality
- **Paimon isn't pure evil:** Functions as a corrupted teacher, showing you yourself
- **The nuns weren't innocent:** Poisoned by alchemical hubris, not demonic possession

### Player Agency vs. Determinism

- **Illusion of control:** Many choices lead to same outcome (Hangman always dies)
- **Meaningful choices:** Combat difficulty is directly tied to player behavior
- **Meta-recognition:** Game acknowledges when players try to break the system
- **Persistent consequences:** Your corruption profile shapes future experiences

### Atmosphere Through Restraint

- **Minimal jump scares:** Horror comes from realization, not shock
- **Timed silence:** Pauses between messages build tension
- **Glitch effects sparingly:** Only at key revelation moments
- **Paimon's tone:** Never screaming or overwrought, just coldly honest

---

## CLOSING PHILOSOPHY

**iOuija73k** is a game about choices and consequences, wrapped in psychological horror. Every violent action, every mercy attempt, every moment of hesitation is recorded, analyzed, and used to shape Paimon's relationship with the player. The demon isn't just an antagonist‚Äîit's a mirror reflecting your behavioral patterns back at you.

The corruption system isn't about punishing "bad" players or rewarding "good" ones. It's about creating a personalized horror experience where your natural tendencies determine the difficulty, tone, and ultimate revelation. Are you someone who strikes first and asks questions later? Are you someone who tries to save everyone, even when the system is rigged against you? Or are you someone who learns, adapts, and changes their approach across multiple playthroughs?

Paimon is watching. Paimon is learning. Paimon remembers.

**Will you?**
